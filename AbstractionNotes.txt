What is abstraction?
Showing only essential part and hiding implementation details.

Why should we use abstraction?
It hides complexity
provides Security

which action needs to preform  => how to perform that action


Abstract class rules:
1) It's not mandatory to have abstract method in abstract class.
2) If we define any abstract method in a class, then that class must be abstract class.
3) We can not create an object of abstract class.
4) If one abstract class extends another abstract class.
then it's not mandatory for that child class to provide method implementations of abstract methods of super class.

5) If concrete/non-abstract class extends  abstract class.
then its  mandatory for that child class to provide method implementations of abstract methods of super class.
